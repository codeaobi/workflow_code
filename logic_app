For a no-code approach, Azure Logic Apps can be used.

Steps:
Create a Logic App in Azure

Go to Azure Portal → Logic Apps → Create a new Logic App.
Set Up a Recurring Trigger

Add a Schedule Trigger → Set it to run every 24 hours.
Add GitHub as a Data Source

Connect to GitHub using your credentials.
Use the "Get repository content" action to fetch files.
Upload to Azure Blob

Use the "Create Blob" action to upload the files.
Save and Activate the Logic App

Azure will now fetch and upload the repository data daily.
